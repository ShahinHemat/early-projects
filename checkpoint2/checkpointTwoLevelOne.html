    Eirik accepted this solution, but advised me 
    to change text to textarea for element above the button,
    and to give the container a max-width. 

    In the solution below, I've implemented those two things.

    PS: Eirik also told me that a much simpler solution
    to this exercise, would be to simply not use grid. 
    I could have created a div class="container", given it some padding and then put
    everything else in divs inside of that. That would get rid of the problem
    that occurs when the size gets too small (the heading wouldn't fall under the first input field).
